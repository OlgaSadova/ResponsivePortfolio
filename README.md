# ResponsivePortfolio
* The main code is saved in index.html file.

* My portfolio site was recreated with Bootstrap grid system.

* It contain navbar, containers, rows, colums, sub-rows and sub-colums.

* The images are adjusted to be responsive images.

* As a bonus, I used an example from Bootstap documentation to make page footer to be sticky footer.
I had to create another CSS file to make footer style
